# Stream processing with Azure Databricks

This reference architecture shows an end-to-end [stream processing](/azure/architecture/data-guide/big-data/real-time-processing) pipeline. This type of pipeline has four stages: ingest, process, store, and analysis and reporting. For this reference architecture, the pipeline ingests data from two sources, performs a join on related records from each stream, enriches the result, and calculates an average in real time. The results are stored for further analysis.

**Scenario**: A taxi company collects data about each taxi trip. For this scenario, we assume there are two separate devices sending data. The taxi has a meter that sends information about each ride &mdash; the duration, distance, and pickup and dropoff locations. A separate device accepts payments from customers and sends data about fares. To spot ridership trends, the taxi company wants to calculate the average tip per mile driven, in real time, for each neighborhood.
